## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-17

### Bug Fix Release

**Critical Fixes**
- 🐛 Fixed render target read/write conflicts causing compilation errors
- 🐛 Fixed gradient instruction errors in dynamic loops
- 🐛 Fixed incomplete normal reconstruction function
- 🐛 Improved shader compilation stability for ReShade 5.9+

**Technical Changes**
- Added intermediate temporal buffers for AO, GI, and reflections (3 new render targets)
- Added 3 copy passes to resolve render target conflicts
- Implemented `SampleDepthLod()` function for loop-safe depth sampling
- Replaced all `tex2D()` with `tex2Dlod()` in dynamic loops
- Completed missing code in `ReconstructNormal()` function

**Affected Files**
- `ME1_PathTracing.fx` - Added temporal buffers and copy passes
- `ME1_PT_Common.fxh` - New LOD sampling functions
- `ME1_PT_AO.fxh` - LOD sampling in horizon angle calculation
- `ME1_PT_GI.fxh` - LOD sampling in ray marching loops
- `ME1_PT_Reflections.fxh` - LOD sampling in reflection tracing

**User Impact**
- ✅ Shaders now compile successfully without errors
- ✅ No visual changes - all fixes are technical
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ No configuration changes needed
- ⚠️ Users with v1.0.0 should update for stability

## Bug Fixes

*No bugs fixed yet - this is the initial release*

---

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0.0
1. **Temporal ghosting during fast camera rotation**
   - Workaround: Reduce temporal blend factor to 0.85-0.90
   - Status: By design (trade-off), may improve in future

2. **Performance lower than expected on some AMD GPUs**
   - Workaround: Use Performance preset, reduce max ray distance
   - Status: Investigating AMD-specific optimizations for 1.1.0

3. **Occasional flickering with specific texture mods**
   - Workaround: Disable conflicting textures or reduce denoise strength
   - Status: Under investigation

4. **Blue noise texture fails to load on some systems**
   - Workaround: Try different PNG formats (PNG-8 vs PNG-24)
   - Status: Investigating loader compatibility for 1.1.0

5. **Edge artifacts on ultra-wide monitors (21:9, 32:9)**
   - Workaround: Acceptable, inherent to screen-space techniques
   - Status: May improve with better edge detection in 1.1.0
