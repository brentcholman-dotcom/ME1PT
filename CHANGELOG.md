## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-16

### Initial Release

**Major Features**
- ✨ Hybrid path tracing implementation for Mass Effect 1 Legendary Edition
- 🌟 Multi-bounce global illumination (2-3 bounces)
- ✨ Ray-traced screen-space reflections with cone tracing
- 🌑 Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO)
- ⚡ Temporal accumulation for noise reduction
- 🎚️ Adaptive quality system (Low/Medium/High/Ultra)

**Shader Modules**
- `ME1_PathTracing.fx` - Main integration shader with UI
- `ME1_PT_Common.fxh` - Shared utilities and functions
- `ME1_PT_AO.fxh` - GTAO implementation with bent normals
- `ME1_PT_GI.fxh` - Global illumination with hierarchical ray marching
- `ME1_PT_Reflections.fxh` - Stochastic reflections with material awareness

**Presets**
- Performance.ini - For mid-range GPUs (10-20% FPS impact)
- Balanced.ini - Recommended preset (20-30% FPS impact)
- Quality.ini - Maximum quality (30-50% FPS impact)

**Documentation**
- Comprehensive installation guide
- Quick reference card for in-game use
- Technical overview for developers
- Blue noise texture guide with multiple sourcing options

**Quality Features**
- Temporal accumulation (16-32 frames)
- Bilateral denoising for all effects
- Blue noise sampling for better distribution
- Disocclusion detection for temporal reprojection
- Debug visualization modes for troubleshooting

**Performance Optimizations**
- Hierarchical ray marching with adaptive step size
- Early ray termination for efficiency
- Distance-based level of detail
- Texture fetch optimizations
- Configurable ray counts per quality level

**Known Limitations** (Documented)
- Screen-space only (no off-screen reflections/lighting)
- Temporal ghosting during fast camera movement
- Material properties estimated from color (not always perfect)
- Performance cost of 30-50% FPS on Quality preset

## Bug Fixes

*No bugs fixed yet - this is the initial release*

---

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0.0
1. **Temporal ghosting during fast camera rotation**
   - Workaround: Reduce temporal blend factor to 0.85-0.90
   - Status: By design (trade-off), may improve in future

2. **Performance lower than expected on some AMD GPUs**
   - Workaround: Use Performance preset, reduce max ray distance
   - Status: Investigating AMD-specific optimizations for 1.1.0

3. **Occasional flickering with specific texture mods**
   - Workaround: Disable conflicting textures or reduce denoise strength
   - Status: Under investigation

4. **Blue noise texture fails to load on some systems**
   - Workaround: Try different PNG formats (PNG-8 vs PNG-24)
   - Status: Investigating loader compatibility for 1.1.0

5. **Edge artifacts on ultra-wide monitors (21:9, 32:9)**
   - Workaround: Acceptable, inherent to screen-space techniques
   - Status: May improve with better edge detection in 1.1.0
